# tkinter_python
A Python based GUI which consists of a form, asking user the various necessary details.
I have used the Tkinter library of python to make this GUI. Also, the details which are entered are save in the .yaml format by default but can be changed at the time of submission. This was possible with the asksaveasfile extension of tkinter.
